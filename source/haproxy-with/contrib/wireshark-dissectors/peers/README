------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that at this time, HAProxy Peers Protocol dissection is not supported
on Windows systems (could not be tested).

1) File list
-------------
 - packet-happp.c: source code for HAProxy Peers Procotol (HAPPP) dissection
   support.
 - wireshark.happp.dissector.patch: a patch file for wireshark sources to enable HAPPP
   dissection support. Note that this patch file modifies only two files:
   (epan/dissectors/CMakeLists.txt and epan/dissectors/Makefile.am) to add
   packet-happp.c file DISSECTOR_SRC variable which list all wireshark
 - README: this file.
