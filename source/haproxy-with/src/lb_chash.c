 * Consistent Hash implementation
 * Please consult this very well detailed article for more information :
 * http://www.spiteful.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing/
 *
 * Our implementation has to support both weighted hashing and weighted round
 * robin because we'll use it to replace the previous map-based implementation
 * which offered both algorithms.
