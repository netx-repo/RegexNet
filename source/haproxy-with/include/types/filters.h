 * Callbacks available on a filter:
 *
 *  - init                : Initializes the filter for a proxy. Returns a
 *                          negative value if an error occurs.
 *  - deinit              : Cleans up what the init function has done.
 *  - check               : Check the filter config for a proxy. Returns the
 *                          number of errors encountered.
 * - init_per_thread      : Initializes the filter for a proxy for a specific
 *                          thread. Returns a negative value if an error
 *                          occurs.
 * - deinit_per_thread    : Cleans up what the init_per_thread funcion has
 *                          done.
 *
 *
 *  - attach              : Called after a filter instance creation, when it is
 *                          attached to a stream. This happens when the stream
 *                          is started for filters defined on the stream's
 *                          frontend and when the backend is set for filters
 *                          declared on the stream's backend.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          the filter must be ignored for the stream, any other
 *                          value otherwise.
 *  - stream_start        : Called when a stream is started. This callback will
 *                          only be called for filters defined on the stream's

 *                          other value otherwise.
 *  - stream_set_backend  : Called when a backend is set for a stream. This
 *                          callbacks will be called for all filters attached
 *                          to a stream (frontend and backend).
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, any
 *                          other value otherwise.
 *  - stream_stop         : Called when a stream is stopped. This callback will
 *                          only be called for filters defined on the stream's
 *                          frontend.
 *  - detach              : Called when a filter instance is detached from a
 *                          stream, before its destruction. This happens when
 *                          the stream is stopped for filters defined on the
 *                          stream's frontend and when the analyze ends for
 *                          filters defined on the stream's backend.
 *  - check_timeouts      : Called when a a stream is woken up because of an
 *                          expired timer.
 *
 *
 *  - channel_start_analyze: Called when a filter starts to analyze a channel.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *  - channel_pre_analyze : Called before each analyzer attached to a channel,
 *                          expects analyzers responsible for data sending.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *  - channel_post_analyze: Called after each analyzer attached to a channel,
 *                          expects analyzers responsible for data sending.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs,
 *                          any other value otherwise.
 *  - channel_end_analyze : Called when all other analyzers have finished their
 *                          processing.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *
 *
 *  - http_headers        : Called before the body parsing, after all HTTP
 *                          headers was parsed and analyzed.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *  - http_data           : Called when unparsed body data are available.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, else
 *                          the number of consumed bytes.
 *  - http_chunk_trailers : Called when part of trailer headers of a
 *                          chunk-encoded request/response are ready to be
 *                          processed.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, any
 *                          other value otherwise.
 *  - http_end            : Called when all the request/response has been
 *                          processed and all body data has been forwarded.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait for some reason, any other value
 *                          otherwise.
 *  - http_reset          : Called when the HTTP message is reseted. It happens
 *                          when a 100-continue response is received.
 *                          Returns nothing.
 *  - http_reply          : Called when, at any time, HA proxy decides to stop
 *                          the HTTP message's processing and to send a message
 *                          to the client (mainly, when an error or a redirect
 *                          occur).
 *                          Returns nothing.
 *  - http_forward_data   : Called when some data can be consumed.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, else
 *                          the number of forwarded bytes.

 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, else
 *                          the number of consumed bytes.
 *  - tcp_forward_data    : Called when some data can be consumed.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, else
