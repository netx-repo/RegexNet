 *
 * This code implements an events cache for file descriptors. It remembers the
 * readiness of a file descriptor after a return from poll() and the fact that
 * an I/O attempt failed on EAGAIN. Events in the cache which are still marked
 * ready and active are processed just as if they were reported by poll().
 *
 * This serves multiple purposes. First, it significantly improves performance
 * by avoiding to subscribe to polling unless absolutely necessary, so most
 * events are processed without polling at all, especially send() which
 * benefits from the socket buffers. Second, it is the only way to support
 * edge-triggered pollers (eg: EPOLL_ET). And third, it enables I/O operations
 * that are backed by invisible buffers. For example, SSL is able to read a
 * whole socket buffer and not deliver it to the application buffer because
 * it's full. Unfortunately, it won't be reported by a poller anymore until
 * some new activity happens. The only way to call it again thus is to keep
 * this readiness information in the cache and to access it without polling
 * once the FD is enabled again.
 *
 * One interesting feature of the cache is that it maintains the principle
 * of speculative I/O introduced in haproxy 1.3 : the first time an event is
 * enabled, the FD is considered as ready so that the I/O attempt is performed
 * via the cache without polling. And the polling happens only when EAGAIN is
 * first met. This avoids polling for HTTP requests, especially when the
 * defer-accept mode is used. It also avoids polling for sending short data
 * such as requests to servers or short responses to clients.
 *
 * The cache consists in a list of active events and a list of updates.
 * Active events are events that are expected to come and that we must report
 * to the application until it asks to stop or asks to poll. Updates are new
 * requests for changing an FD state. Updates are the only way to create new
 * events. This is important because it means that the number of cached events
 * cannot increase between updates and will only grow one at a time while
 * processing updates. All updates must always be processed, though events
 * might be processed by small batches if required.
 *
 * There is no direct link between the FD and the updates list. There is only a
 * bit in the fdtab[] to indicate than a file descriptor is already present in
 * the updates list. Once an fd is present in the updates list, it will have to
 * be considered even if its changes are reverted in the middle or if the fd is
 * replaced.
 *
 * It is important to understand that as long as all expected events are
 * processed, they might starve the polled events, especially because polled
 * I/O starvation quickly induces more cached I/O. One solution to this
 * consists in only processing a part of the events at once, but one drawback
 * is that unhandled events will still wake the poller up. Using an edge-
 * triggered poller such as EPOLL_ET will solve this issue though.
 *
 * Since we do not want to scan all the FD list to find cached I/O events,
 * we store them in a list consisting in a linear array holding only the FD
 * indexes right now. Note that a closed FD cannot exist in the cache, because
 * it is closed by fd_delete() which in turn calls fd_release_cache_entry()
 * which always removes it from the list.
 *
 * The FD array has to hold a back reference to the cache. This reference is
 * always valid unless the FD is not in the cache and is not updated, in which
 * case the reference points to index 0.
 *
 * The event state for an FD, as found in fdtab[].state, is maintained for each
 * direction. The state field is built this way, with R bits in the low nibble
 * and W bits in the high nibble for ease of access and debugging :
 *
 *               7    6    5    4   3    2    1    0
 *             [ 0 | PW | RW | AW | 0 | PR | RR | AR ]
 *
 *                   A* = active     *R = read
 *                   P* = polled     *W = write
 *                   R* = ready
 *
 * An FD is marked "active" when there is a desire to use it.
 * An FD is marked "polled" when it is registered in the polling.
 * An FD is marked "ready" when it has not faced a new EAGAIN since last wake-up
 * (it is a cache of the last EAGAIN regardless of polling changes).
 *
 * We have 8 possible states for each direction based on these 3 flags :
 *
 *   +---+---+---+----------+---------------------------------------------+
 *   | P | R | A | State    | Description				  |
 *   +---+---+---+----------+---------------------------------------------+
 *   | 0 | 0 | 0 | DISABLED | No activity desired, not ready.		  |
 *   | 0 | 0 | 1 | MUSTPOLL | Activity desired via polling.		  |
 *   | 0 | 1 | 0 | STOPPED  | End of activity without polling.		  |
 *   | 0 | 1 | 1 | ACTIVE   | Activity desired without polling.		  |
 *   | 1 | 0 | 0 | ABORT    | Aborted poll(). Not frequently seen.	  |
 *   | 1 | 0 | 1 | POLLED   | FD is being polled.			  |
 *   | 1 | 1 | 0 | PAUSED   | FD was paused while ready (eg: buffer full) |
 *   | 1 | 1 | 1 | READY    | FD was marked ready by poll()		  |
 *   +---+---+---+----------+---------------------------------------------+
 *
 * The transitions are pretty simple :
 *   - fd_want_*() : set flag A
 *   - fd_stop_*() : clear flag A
 *   - fd_cant_*() : clear flag R (when facing EAGAIN)
 *   - fd_may_*()  : set flag R (upon return from poll())
 *   - sync()      : if (A) { if (!R) P := 1 } else { P := 0 }
 *
 * The PAUSED, ABORT and MUSTPOLL states are transient for level-trigerred
 * pollers and are fixed by the sync() which happens at the beginning of the
 * poller. For event-triggered pollers, only the MUSTPOLL state will be
 * transient and ABORT will lead to PAUSED. The ACTIVE state is the only stable
 * one which has P != A.
 *
 * The READY state is a bit special as activity on the FD might be notified
 * both by the poller or by the cache. But it is needed for some multi-layer
 * protocols (eg: SSL) where connection activity is not 100% linked to FD
 * activity. Also some pollers might prefer to implement it as ACTIVE if
 * enabling/disabling the FD is cheap. The READY and ACTIVE states are the
 * two states for which a cache entry is allocated.
 *
 * The state transitions look like the diagram below. Only the 4 right states
 * have polling enabled :
 *
 *          (POLLED=0)          (POLLED=1)
 *
 *          +----------+  sync  +-------+
 *          | DISABLED | <----- | ABORT |         (READY=0, ACTIVE=0)
 *          +----------+        +-------+
 *         clr |  ^           set |  ^
 *             |  |               |  |
 *             v  | set           v  | clr
 *          +----------+  sync  +--------+
 *          | MUSTPOLL | -----> | POLLED |        (READY=0, ACTIVE=1)
 *          +----------+        +--------+
 *                ^          poll |  ^
 *                |               |  |
 *                | EAGAIN        v  | EAGAIN
 *           +--------+         +-------+
 *           | ACTIVE |         | READY |         (READY=1, ACTIVE=1)
 *           +--------+         +-------+
 *         clr |  ^           set |  ^
 *             |  |               |  |
 *             v  | set           v  | clr
 *          +---------+   sync  +--------+
